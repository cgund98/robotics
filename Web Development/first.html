                      <p id="body-1">Junior FIRST LEGO League is designed for children ages 6-9. The program is used to help discover the wonders of science and technology. While working on skills such as research, teamwork, construction, and imagination, children work together to build a robot out of LEGOs.</p>
                      <p id="body-2">FIRST LEGO League is a program for grades 4-8. It introduces younger students to the world of engineering and technology by building LEGO robots to complete tasks on a thematic surface. The children in FLL learn many life skills, explore exciting career possibilities, and evenmake positive contributions to society.</p>
                      <p id="body-3">The FIRST Tech Challenge leagues are composed of students, grades 7-12, that use sport models to compete head-to-head. Each team is responsible for designing, building, and programming their robot. The teams are placed on alliances composed of 2 teams and compete against other alliances.</p>
                      <p id="body-4">Under strict rules, limited parts, and time limits, FIRST Robotics Competition teams, which are made up of 25 or more high school students, are challenged to build a robot that accomplishes the year’s “challenge”.  The teams are required to raise funds, design a team “brand”, strengthen team work skills, and completely create a robot out of scratch. This branch of FIRST is as close to “real-world engineering” as students can get.</p>

                <p>This year’s game is called FIRST Stronghold and defense is back!  Teams begin the match at the center of the field and then travel to their opponents side and destroy their tower.  Blocking each alliance’s tower is set of obstacles called defenses which robots must traverse in order to get near the tower.  These defenses included ramps, bumps, and gates.</p>
